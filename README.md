# ec2_exercise
Home assignment fron Cymptom that tests extracting data from aws ec2 instances.


Hi there!

I created a Flask app that displays in a web browser. The app includes sign-up and login functionality, and there is already a user for you:

username: ziv@ziv.com password: cymptom

Note: I removed AWS credentials. Please insert the real credentials before running the app.
